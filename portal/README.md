A portal to render Imgur images.

This is a React/TS App built with Vite and TailwindCSS. It uses Express to server side render the application.

> The project requires a env file with INITIAL_STATE_GALLERY_API and INITIAL_STATE_SEARCH_API declared. These values are the endpoints for fetching data.

A Docker file is in place to facilitate deployment. For the purposes of demonstration I have used Fly.io to easily deploy the final result.
