### GET /gallery
Implements the [Gallery API](https://apidocs.imgur.com/#eff60e84-5781-4c12-926a-208dc4c7cc94). It receives the same routes and params but all as params. 

Example: `/gallery?section=hot&sort=viral&window=day&page=1&showViral=false&mature=false`
### GET /search
Implements the [Gallery Search API](https://apidocs.imgur.com/#3c981acf-47aa-488f-b068-269f65aee3ce) with a defined sort, window, and page. It receives the `q` param. 

Example: `/search?q=cats`
